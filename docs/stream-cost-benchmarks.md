# Stream cost benchmark reports

The [initial versioned reports](../reports/stream-cost/v1/) cover idle, read-heavy, balanced, and write-dominant workloads at small, medium, and large document sizes. Each JSON file names its workload and records the revision, versions, resource limits, workload parameters, warmup counters, latency distributions, aggregate elapsed time, process CPU, MongoDB container CPU, and logical cache and stream measurements.

Run the same matrix locally with an isolated MongoDB replica set:

```console
uv run -- python -m benchmarks.stream_cost.run --output-dir benchmark-reports
```

The optional `--direct-path-proxy` flag also measures bytes on the dedicated client-to-container path. Those bytes represent only that path. Logical event bytes are decoded event sizes; neither value is a general measure of network traffic.

To reproduce the [decision evidence](../reports/stream-cost/v1/decision-evidence.report.v1.json) for the consolidated stream and oversized result on your host, run:

```sh
uv run -- python -m benchmarks.stream_cost.decision_evidence --output decision-evidence.report.v1.json
```

The runner uses the [recorded workload and decision thresholds](../reports/stream-cost/v1/decision-pre-registration.json). Compare its outcomes only with a comparable host and topology; the retained report supports decisions for its stated workload.

Choose a workload by the traffic you expect: `idle` for a connected cache with no sampled operations, `read_heavy` for mostly reads, `balanced` for similar read and write counts, or `write_dominant` for mostly writes. Compare only reports with matching workload parameters and comparable environments. The raw and cache reads are sampled as separate phases, followed by a shared write phase; a report does not measure interleaved read and write latency. A shared write sample appears in both variant summaries so each summary accounts for the same executed operations.

For example, the [read-heavy, small-document report](../reports/stream-cost/v1/read_heavy-small.report.v1.json) describes that exact workload and run. Its latency rows separate raw reads from cache hits, misses, and bypasses. The idle reports explicitly record zero sampled operations and no latency samples. These local reports do not establish a performance conclusion for another host, database, or workload.

The GitHub Actions **Stream cost benchmark** workflow runs when someone starts it from **Actions → Stream cost benchmark → Run workflow** and selects a branch. GitHub calls this a manual `workflow_dispatch`; the workflow must first exist on the repository's default branch. See [GitHub's manual workflow guide](https://docs.github.com/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).

Run it after a cache or stream change to capture a repeatable report set for that revision. Download the **stream-cost-reports** artifact from the completed run, then compare matching workload and size rows with the retained reports or another run on a comparable runner. Use differences in cache outcomes, latency, CPU, and logical stream activity to choose what to investigate next. Runner performance varies, so timing differences are evidence to inspect rather than an automatic pass/fail threshold; setup and report-validation failures still fail the workflow.
